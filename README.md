# Welcome 👋

This is my coding corner.  
A place for experiments, side projects, and curious ideas.  

## 📂 My Playgrounds

- [**js-playground**](https://github.com/MinixLi/js-playground) → JavaScript experiments and toys, old and new  
- [**ruby-playground**](https://github.com/MinixLi/ruby-playground) → Ruby experiments, event-driven servers

✨ If you also enjoy coding, I hope you find something positive here. ✨
